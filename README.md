# 100gb-zipbomb
The Packed.zip file is compressed to a small size
DO NOT unzip it unless you want to lag your computer, as doing so will uncompress all the files inside back to their original 100gb size

If you want to send it to someone it's highly recommended to rename the file into something that the receiver would unzip without bothering to peek inside first

i take absolute 0 responsibility if you mess up
